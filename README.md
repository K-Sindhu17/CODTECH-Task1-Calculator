Overview of the Project:

Project: Simple Calculator

Objective:
This Python project is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program will then calculate and display the result of the chosen operation.

Key Activities:
1. User Input: Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2. Operation Selection: Ask the user to choose an operation(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. Calculation: Perform the selected operation on the two numbers.
4. Result Display: Show the calculated result to the user.

Technologies Used:
1. Python: The main programming language used to develop the calculator.
2. Input/Output Functions: Python's `input()` function for user input and `print()` function for displaying results.
3. Basic Arithmetic Operators: Python's built-in operators for addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
